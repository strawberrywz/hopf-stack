# Hopf Algebra CDK Project

This repository contains an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) project named "Hopf Algebra". It's designed to deploy and manage AWS resources using infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- AWS CLI
- AWS CDK CLI

## Setting up AWS CLI Access

1. Install the AWS CLI if you haven't already:

   ```
   npm install -g aws-cli
   ```

2. Configure your AWS CLI with your credentials:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```
   You'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hopf-algebra.git
   cd hopf-algebra
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Bootstrap your AWS environment (if you haven't already):
   ```
   cdk bootstrap
   ```

## Useful Commands

- `cdk deploy`: Deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff`: Compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth`: Emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## Project Structure

- `bin/`: Entry point for the CDK app
- `lib/`: Contains the stack definition(s)
- `test/`: Unit tests
- `cdk.json`: CDK context and configuration

## Modifying the Stack

To modify the resources in your stack, edit the files in the `lib/` directory. After making changes, you can run `cdk diff` to see what changes will be applied, and `cdk deploy` to deploy the changes.

## Security

Remember to never commit AWS credentials to the repository. Use AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables for sensitive information.
